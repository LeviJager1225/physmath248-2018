    "Newton's method is the technique of iteratively using the linear approximation of a function to search for roots.  Say we want to find a solution to the equation\n",

    "$$f(x) = 0$$\n",

    "where, $f$ is a real-valued function of a real variable $f : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$.\n",

    "This illustrates the compromise made with Newton's method: if one does not have a convenient direct way to compute square roots, one can get a good approximation by iteratively computing $N_f$, which uses only the operations of addition, multiplication and division. \n",

    "As an initial exercise, let's use Sympy to compute the Newton iterates of functions.  We will then make a plot of $f$, $N$ as well as applications of the Newton iterate to some initial guesses. \n"
