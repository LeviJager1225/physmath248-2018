    "### The problem\n",
    "A circuit of resistors, all with the same resistance, connects ground with a power rail at the voltage $V_\\mathrm{Rail}$ as shown in this diagram: ![Resistor](../images/ResistorCircuit.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem in physics may involve that we  want to know the voltages at each of the junctions, $V_1, V_2, \\dots$ when $V_\\mathrm{Rail}$ is given and all resistors have the same  resistance $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of this problem involves two aspects:\n",
    "1. Kirchhoff current law (a conservation law): The sum of all currents at any junction points must be zero.\n",
    "2. Ohm's law: The relation between current $I$, voltage $V$ and resistance is $$R = \\frac{V}{I}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These fundamental electricitiy problems can be best understood in terms of the water analogy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up equations\n",
    "* The current between two junctions is given by the voltage difference divided by the resistance (Ohm's law).\n",
    "* For each junction the sum of the currents into (or out of) the junction must be zero, i.e. in the voltage differences must contain the voltage at the junction with the same sign \n",
    "* Since the resistance is the same for all resistors it cancels and I we can ommit it right from the beginning. \n",
    "* $V_\\mathrm{Rail} = 5 \\mathrm{V}$\n",
